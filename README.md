# Blackbox Library [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) ![open source](https://badgen.net/badge/open/source/blue?icon=github)

The Blackbox library is a port (modification) of the Blackbox implementation by Nicholas Sherlock (aka thenickdude),
see https://github.com/thenickdude/blackbox
It also contains Kustaa Nyholm's `printf` implementation.
This library is written C++. (The original was written in C).

The main changes in this library are:

1. Code has been converted to C++.
2. Dependencies (ie configs, features, sensors etc) have been removed and abstracted into callbacks,
   so this library can be used on its own.

## Notes on Blackbox tasks and scheduling

Betaflight uses non-preemptive cooperative scheduling. This means tasks undertake activities that
take a long time need to yield while undertaking those activities. Betaflight uses two common design patterns
to do this:

1. Splitting an activity into reasonable chunks and using a state machine to sequence through those chunks.
2. Making asynchronous calls to a function with a callback for when that function completes.

In Betaflight, Blackbox runs as a subtask of the MainPidLoop task, which typically runs at 8kHz. Blackbox
can be configured to run at a submultiple of that frequency (ie 4kHz, 2kHz, etc).

## Notes on the port

This is very much a "minimal effort" port - just enough work was done to get it working for ProtoFlight and SelfBalancingRobot.

This means the code is a curious mix of both my style and the original style. It is also a curious mix of C-like code and C++-like code.

## Simplified Class Diagram

All writing to the serial device is done via the `BlackboxEncoder`

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BlackboxEncoder {
        write(uint8_t value)
    }
    class Blackbox {
        <<abstract>>
        writeSystemInformation() write_e *
        virtual update() uint32_t
    }
    class BlackboxCallbacksBase {
        <<abstract>>
        loadSlowState() *
        loadMainState() *
    }
    class BlackboxMessageQueueBase {
        <<abstract>>
        WAIT_IF_EMPTY() const int32_t *
    }
    class BlackboxSerialDevice {
        <<abstract>>
    }
    class BlackboxSerialDeviceSDCard["BlackboxSerialDeviceSDCard(eg)"]

    Blackbox o-- BlackboxMessageQueueBase
    Blackbox o-- BlackboxCallbacksBase : calls loadState
    Blackbox *-- BlackboxEncoder : calls write
    BlackboxEncoder o-- BlackboxSerialDevice : calls write

    %%BlackboxSerialDevice --o BlackboxEncoder : calls write
    BlackboxSerialDevice <|-- BlackboxSerialDeviceSDCard

    TaskBase <|-- BlackboxTask
    class BlackboxTask {
        +loop()
        -task() [[noreturn]]
    }
    BlackboxTask o-- BlackboxMessageQueueBase : calls WAIT_IF_EMPTY
    BlackboxTask o-- Blackbox : calls update
